# AUTOMATED-TIMETABLE-GENERATOR-USING-JAVA
An automated timetable generator (ATG) is a powerful tool that simplifies the often complicated and time-consuming process of preparing schedules. It organises scheduling by taking into account numerous elements like resource availability, space allocation, and user preferences by leveraging cutting-edge algorithms and artificial intelligence. It successfully manages restrictions like instructor availability and room capacity while working to maximize resource use and reduce conflicts. 
Manual timetable creation can be time-consuming, especially for larger institutions. An automatic timetable generator can significantly reduce the time and effort required to create and update schedules. Automatic generators can optimize the timetable based on various constraints and preferences, such as teacher availability, room constraints, and subject requirements. This ensures that the timetable is efficiently organized and meets the needs of both students and staff.
As we created this project in java, tools and technology used is java, eclipse ide, packages such as arrays, util.scanner. 
We created Java program that generates a timetable for a school week with five days and five classes per day. It takes min as array convert it in hours and each periods is of 60 min duration. The timetable is represented as a 2D array of Strings, where each cell contains information about the subject, teacher, and time. The formatTime method is used to convert time from minutes to the HH:mm format. It's a good practice to separate concerns like time formatting into a dedicated method.
The nested loops iterate over days and periods, assigning subjects and teachers to each timetable slot. The class index is used to cycle through the subjects.
A break is added after the second period.
In conclusion, an automatic timetable generator is a valuable tool for educational institutions, providing several benefits and efficiencies in the scheduling process. In conclusion, an automatic timetable generator is a valuable tool for educational institutions, providing several benefits and efficiencies in the scheduling process. The code successfully achieves its goal of generating a schedule based on user input. Demonstrates good use of arrays, loops, and conditional statements.
